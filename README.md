 Our Study Buddy application is a resource that helps people who are trying out new ways to study for a test or practice their vocabulary. 

Motivation

Our motivation sprouted from the fact that for most of us, English is NOT our primary language. So, we wanted to create an application to also help those who are trying to memorize vocabulary by playing a couple of games to get their brain stimulated and hopefully help them remember words that were tricky to remember before. 

How to use Study Buddy

If you are new, You have to creat an acount. Once that is done, you will appear on the home page and then you can add a new vocabulary list by clicking the link or going to Vocabulary List. After you've finished adding your vocabulary you can navigate to home and then you can begin to play one of two games that will help you study!
